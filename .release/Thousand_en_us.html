<p>The game uses 5 dice. Each player takes turns rolling the dice. If all or part of the dice form a combination,
the player may optionally roll all or the remainder of the dice respectively again. Only after all the dice
have taken part in the combinations, they can all be rolled again.</p>
<p>Each roll brings points (for each roll they are counted separately), which are accumulated until the player
saves them. Unsaved points are burned if some roll didn’t give any combinations. When saving points or when they
burn out, the turn passes to the next player. The game continues until one of the players gets exactly 1000 points.</p>
<p>Combinations that allow you to perform an additional roll:</p>

<p>It should be noted that if the sum of the saved and current points exceeds 1000, the current points are also burned.</p>
<p>In addition, there are so-called “casks” in the game (in the app they’re indicated on the scales from above by red
areas). These are the cases where the points saved are in one of the following ranges: <strong>0 to 100</strong> (not including 100),
<strong>300 to 400</strong> (not including 400), or <strong>700 to 800</strong> (not including 800). In these cases, the dice must be rolled until
the sum of points leaves these ranges.</p>
<p>Blue scales allow you to navigate with the “casks”, indicating where the player will be relative to them if he saves
points. The yellow bars show the points already saved.</p>
